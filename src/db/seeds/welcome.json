        "In the beginning, Meridian was a world of fantasy. Humans lived simple lives beside their goddess, Miira, and her dragons. Together they transformed a quiet world into paradise. Then the elves arrived.",
        "The elves were refugees, traveling the stars, fleeing a now-forgotten enemy. They were scientists and inventors, creatures of logic driven by hubris to remake the world in their image. A war was waged and as the age of men came to an end, the elves erected an empire that would survive millennia.",
        "Yet, that was long ago. Now the world carries the scars of both pasts, but has moved on. Through the same genetic experiments that sired half-elves, the so-called “Lesser Races” have diversified culture, art and politics. Nations war for modern reasons. Sending armies into battle against both other nations and the ever-rising monsters, fiends and mythic beasts who constantly threaten to bring civilization to ruin. While politicians scheme for power and southern technology wars with northern magic, the world is as complicated as ever.",
        "Heroes are needed. Even if only to keep this fragile world spinning for another day."
