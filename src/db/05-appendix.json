Most of these creatures are thoughtless manifestations of corruption and destruction. But there are a few extremely powerful demons that have full sentience and martial the forces of the Bloodlands for their own, unknowable purposes. While their existence is universal knowledge throughout Meridian, direct contact with these creatures is extremely rare."
