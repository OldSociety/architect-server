        "The Red Horde rules Uruban's mountainous wastelands uniting hundreds of Uru communities under a single black banner. As a theological hegemony, the Horde is the head religious and political body within the region. Under the guidance of its Night Blood priests, they have established a culture and religion based solely on the worship and reverence of Udreth-sol, Seraph of death and the afterlife.",
        "The Horde operates from Uruban's monastery capital at the heart of the empire, Shalath. Here the First Prophet along with his First Council (including the Ministers of the Masses, Minister of Works, and the Minister of War) rule as the final political and religious authority in Uruban. Serving as the final judgement, their decisions are guided by Tsin-sol's 'Validation' - an Arcanum-Uru document which serves as both the Red Horde's Supreme Law and Holy Bible.",
        "Outside of Shalath, five Prophets and their council rule over the lesser monasteries of Udreth-sol. Each temple is charged with protecting a Labyrinth sanctum, the subterranean prison for Uruban's undead and one of the Six Promises (holy relics of the first emperor).",
        "Every 10th Bloody Sun, the Prophets must complete a Trial of Ascension, where they are sent down into the Labyrinth and must find their way back to the surface unharmed - a sign that the Prophet remains in good standing with Udreth-sol. Secretly, the Ascension is steeped with political bribes, blackmail, and the use of necromancy to ensure the power remains within the powerful.",
        "Citizens of the Red Horde live in strict religious, warrior, and worker castes. At the top of the hierarchal pyramid are Night Blood priests who serve as the de facto heads of church and state. Beneath them serve non-Night Blood priests charged with maintaining both temples and the daily lives of their citizens.",
        "Next, the warrior caste is the foundation of the Red Horde's constantly growing war-machine. Led by their Imperial Commandment (the highest-ranking officer), the Horde's military is divided between its army and its 'Death born', a special force made up of powerful priests, paladins, and necromancers.",
        "Lastly, the working caste includes everyone from merchants to tradesmen to guild craftsman. Every member of the Horde is employed to fulfill a service within the community. Service for salvation is the main motivation for the entire population, under threat of imprisonment, banishment, and death.",
        "Personal vendettas are not tolerated by the horde, though many past conflicts are secretly driven by them. While promoting collective salvation and civic duty, the Horde’s working caste has absolutely no political representation and relies on their priests to fulfill their basic needs and yet are expected to conform to the theocratic rule of law of their homeland."

This is unacceptable to the Prophets who have spent years waging a campaign of complete dominance. Tribes and communities that reject the faith are eventually taken by force.",
          "Those that pledge their allegiance to the prophets exchange their freedoms for the protection and salvation of the Horde. Forced to suddenly live a new way of life, eventually the tribe's unique culture and history is inevitably erased. This provides the Horde with new skills and resources to be exploited as their empire continues to grow, without the threat of rebellion."

It is a professional and academic organization, located throughout southern Meridian (nations south of Egress).",
          "Established during the early days of the Zemeri Empire in the Egressian capital, Amenmaatra, by then- Sergeant-in-arms Iric Cimeros, the Ephemeron was the world’s military research institute. Today, the Ephemeron is politically neutral and provides its services publicly to both world leaders and common masses alike.",
          "Along with its public services, its international charter specifies that the Ephemeron is responsible for building detailed lists of known elven technology, both ancient and modern. They provide states with the names, residencies, and political status of their proprietors. Yet, the Ephemeron itself does not include a policing body and cannot themselves enforce these laws.",

As a research institution, the Ephemeron also serves as a museum of sorts. The College of Arbitration in Amenmaatra stores and protects relics, especially those found to be potentially dangerous, from the general public."
