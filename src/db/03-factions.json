          "The Ephemeron Academy of Elven Technology - better known as the Ephemeron (Eff-ehm-err-in) - is an Egressian institution that pioneers the reclamation of lost/forgotten elven technology with the ultimate goal of resurrecting the advanced science of ancient elves. It is a professional and academic organization, located throughout southern Meridian (nations south of Egress).",
          "Established during the early days of the Zemeri Empire in the Egressian capital, Amenmaatra, by then- Sergeant-in-arms Iric Cimeros, the Ephemeron was the world’s military research institute. Today, the Ephemeron is politically neutral and provides its services publicly to both world leaders and common masses alike.",
          "Along with its public services, its international charter specifies that the Ephemeron is responsible for building detailed lists of known elven technology, both ancient and modern. They provide states with the names, residencies, and political status of their proprietors. Yet, the Ephemeron itself does not include a policing body and cannot themselves enforce these laws.",
          "The Ephemeron is funded through private and government contracts to explore newly discovered ruins, along with the sale of common modern technology, and fees for training talented artificers in advance study. As a research institution, the Ephemeron also serves as a museum of sorts. The College of Arbitration in Amenmaatra stores and protects relics, especially those found to be potentially dangerous, from the general public."

          "Rediscovering the technology of the ancient elves is as much a scientific pursuit as it is a religious one. According to followers of the Nobility, without proving their worth, the Fathomless will come to Meridian bringing about the apocalypse. While non-believers are often skeptical of this ancient threat, others believe that through human-elven cooperation, there will finally be peace across Meridian."

Settlements built around elven ruins quickly strip and sell the structures for parts, destroying any chance the Ephemeron might have had to further their studies.",
          "While the churches of Miira are a constant rival for Meridian’s faithful, it is the Ash’a worshippers that are the Ephemeron’s biggest threat. With the god-Queen Aurora’s declaration that elven technology is Meridian’s great evil, tensions have risen towards a breaking point between the two factions. Only the Ephemeron’s current Conservator, Heleran Lorren, and his collective influence with southern governments keep Aurora’s faithful from initiating open conflict."

This has led to multiple controversies over the years, publicly embarrassing both his father and the Curator. Conversely, Emrick is regarded as a fair and well-deliberated judge. In the last 10 years that he has held the position, no ruling has ever been questioned or overturned by the First Proctor."
