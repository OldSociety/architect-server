      "Arxyk (“air-ekk”) is the homeland of the Nyx. Once the island was just like Ash’ahla, lush with magic, but it was devasted by arrival of the elves. For generations, they stripped the land of its resources and forced the human Nyx from their homelands. Only after the end of the elven empire did Nyxen barbarians return, only to find the forests bare and its magic lost.",
      "The remaining wild folk have long endured the slow death of their homeland. Only a thin peace treaty between Fairbourne and Aryxk has kept the threat of genocide at bay. Yet, recently, rumor spreads of a powerful force uniting the Nyxen Rival Clans once again under a single banner, threatening a bloody war once more."
